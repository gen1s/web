                    <p  style = "color: #e9e9e9;">
                        I'm 
                        
                        <span style = "color: #2ccd70;" >Gen1s</span>,
                        a 15 years old european student. Ive been interested in coding since I was 10. I first learned to "program" games in 
                        <span style = "color: #2ccd70;" >Scratch</span>, a cool platform to learn how to code using "bloks" while creating games.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Later i learned to use
                        <span style = "color: #2ccd70;" >Game Maker Studio</span>
                        a easy to use engine for 2D games. My first lines of code were typed in 
                        <span style = "color: #2ccd70;" >GML</span>
                        (Game Maker Language). At this point all I learned by myself all I knew about
                        <span style = "color: #2ccd70;" >Game Maker.</span>
                        After almost a year of using 
                        <span style = "color: #2ccd70;" >Game Maker</span>
                        I got bored and stopped coding.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I was courious and I started learning
                        <span style = "color: #2ccd70;" >C++</span>
                        but i didn't make anything "valuable", just pointless projects. Even though I learned a lot about coding.
                        Eventually I got bored again and stopped programing.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Months later I decided to programm games again. I learned about 
                        <span style = "color: #2ccd70;" >Unity</span>
                        and started doing more complex and ambicious 3D games. I published some of them in the play store. But they are
                        no longer published. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I took about a long brake an then I started learning
                        <span style = "color: #2ccd70;" >Python</span>.
                        It's the programing language I used the most. By this time i created my
                        <span style = "color: #2ccd70;" >Github</span> profile. Where I upload my more usefull/interesting projects.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        And now I'm learning
                        <span style = "color: #2ccd70;" >HTML</span>,
                        <span style = "color: #2ccd70;" >CSS</span> and
                        <span style = "color: #2ccd70;" >Javascript</span>
                        to be able to make this web page.
