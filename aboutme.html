                    I'm 
                    <span style = "color: #2ccd70;" >Gen1s</span>
                    a 15 years old european student. Ive been interested in coding since I was 10. I first learned to "program" games in 
                    <span style = "color: #2ccd70;" >Scratch</span>, a cool platform to learn how to code using "bloks" while creating games.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Later i learned to use
                    <span style = "color: #2ccd70;" >Game Maker Studio</span>
                    a easy to use engine for 2D games. My first lines of code were typed in 
                    <span style = "color: #2ccd70;" >GML</span>
                    (Game Maker Language). At this point all I learned by myself all I knew about
                    <span style = "color: #2ccd70;" >Game Maker.</span>
                    After almost a year of using 
                    <span style = "color: #2ccd70;" >Game Maker</span>
                    I got bored and stopped coding.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I was courious and I started learning
                    <span style = "color: #2ccd70;" >C++</span>
                    but i didn't make anything "valuable", just pointless projects. Even though I learned a lot about coding.
                    Eventually I got bored again and stopped programing.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Months later I decided to programm games again. I learned about 
                    <span style = "color: #2ccd70;" >Unity</span>
                    and started doing more complex and ambicious 3D games. I published some of them in the play store. But they are
                    no longer published. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I took about a long brake an then I started learning
                    <span style = "color: #2ccd70;" >Python</span>.
                    It's the programing language I used the most. By this time i created my
                    <span style = "color: #2ccd70;" >Github</span> profile. Where I upload my more usefull/interesting projects.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And now I'm learning
                    <span style = "color: #2ccd70;" >HTML</span>,
                    <span style = "color: #2ccd70;" >CSS</span> and
                    <span style = "color: #2ccd70;" >Javascript</span>
                    to be able to make this web page.
